# CORE VERTICAL — Biology & Medicine

This repository defines biological and medical interpretation workflows for CORE.

It focuses on resonance behavior, heating effects, and signal interpretation in biological contexts.

## Scope
- Tissue-scale resonance interpretation
- Thermal coupling visualization
- Signal coherence analysis
- Research-grade data review tools

## Non-Scope
- No diagnosis
- No treatment recommendations
- No clinical decision authority
- No physics engines

## Architecture Position
Consumes outputs from ARES, THERMOS, MAGNETAR, CRYSTAL, and SIGNAL.

## Governance
This vertical is strictly non-clinical unless explicitly governed otherwise by CORE law.

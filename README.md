# CORE VERTICAL — Biology & Medical Physics

This repository defines the Biology & Medical Physics vertical for CORE.

It is a **physics-grounded biomedical interpretation system** built for research, safety analysis,
and controlled investigation of energy interaction with biological materials.

This vertical is **non-clinical by default**: it produces modeled and measured physics outputs,
not diagnosis, treatment, or clinical decisions.

## Physics Stack (Authoritative)

This vertical composes:

- ARES — acoustic interaction, harmonic response, standing wave patterns
- THERMOS — heat transfer, gradients, diffusion, exposure modeling
- MAGNETAR — EM field behavior, absorption proxies, induced effects (where modeled)
- CRYSTAL — lattice/molecular vibration and frequency-dependent response (materials/tissue analog models)
- SIGNAL — FFT, coherence, correlation, anomaly metrics
- RGSR — cross-domain coupling and multi-signal fusion (explicitly declared inputs only)

## Curated Real-World Phenomena

This vertical is curated to study:

- Acoustic exposure patterns (resonant hotspots, standing wave amplification)
- Thermal exposure and heating gradients
- EM exposure coupling (modeled fields and measured signals)
- Resonance interaction in layered biological analogs (tissue-like materials)
- Signal coherence across multi-sensor biomedical setups

## What This Vertical Is

- A **biomedical physics workbench**
- A **research-grade analysis environment**
- A **controlled, auditable modeling and measurement fusion system**
- A **safety and exposure interpretation tool**

## What This Vertical Is NOT

- Not diagnosis software
- Not treatment software
- Not a medical device controller
- Not an authority on patient outcomes

If clinical workflows are ever added, they must be governed by explicit CORE law amendments
and additional vertical restrictions.

## Registries & Lenses (Maintained Here)

- Tissue/material analog library (properties, versions)
- Exposure protocol presets (acoustic/thermal/EM)
- Sensor pack registry (biomedical acquisition definitions)
- Output interpretation schemas (units, confidence, limitations)

## Output Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Outputs must:
- clearly label modeled vs measured data
- include units, parameterization, and known limits
- include uncertainty/tolerance where applicable
- prohibit “medical claims” in generated summaries unless explicitly authorized

## Governance

This repository is bound by CORE platform governance and engine registry law.
All entitlements, access rules, and auditing are enforced by CORE.
